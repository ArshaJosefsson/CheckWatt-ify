**CheckWatt-ify - PC ONLY - Supplementary Quotation Tool for OpenSolar (Fall Term 2023)**

Grid balancing services are essential in modern energy systems, ensuring that the supply and demand of electricity on the grid are consistently in equilibrium. CheckWatt's software aggregates the energy resources of multiple users, creating a virtual power plant that can provide these critical balancing services to the grid.

OpenSolar is a free and widely used quoting tool that we initially found valuable as a startup, primarily due to its intuitive and efficient design features. These features allow for the calculation of the yearly production value of solar panels, taking into account factors such as solar hours, roof incline, cardinal direction, and more.

However, OpenSolar had significant limitations at the time of our product offering. Specifically, it did not provide an easy or integrated way to calculate ROI related to the revenue generated by batteries through CheckWatt. Additionally, the platform was not equipped to accurately calculate Swedish subsidies for private battery and solar installations. Furthermore, updating prices within OpenSolar was a cumbersome process.

To address these challenges, I developed CheckWatt-ify, a tool that enables salespeople to generate quotes with accurately calculated and graphically represented ROI, incorporating the correct price and subsidy amounts. We also used CheckWatt-ify to improve the quality of images and PDFs in our quotations, as we were not satisfied with the quality provided by the OpenSolar platform.

Hidden Button
-------------
At the bottom of the GUI, there is a hidden button that allows users to search for an address and retrieve an image of the property from Google Maps via their API. This feature was envisioned as the first step toward developing our own design tool and ultimately integrating the entire quoting process internally, eliminating the need for reliance on OpenSolar or any other external service.
